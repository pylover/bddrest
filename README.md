## Quick start

### Writing tests

Using `given`, `when`, `then` and `and_` functions as you see in the example below, you can determine and assert 
the behaviour of yout `REST API`.

The `composer` and `response` objects are two proxies for currently writing story(*inside the with given( ... ): context*) 
and the last response after a `given` and or `when`.

```python

import sys
import json

from bddrest.authoring import given, when, then, and_, response, composer


def wsgi_application(environ, start_response):
    path = environ['PATH_INFO']
    if path.endswith('/None'):
        start_response('404 Not Found', [('Content-Type', 'text/plain;charset=utf-8')])
        yield b''
    else:
        start_response('200 OK', [('Content-Type', 'application/json;charset=utf-8')])
        result = json.dumps(dict(
            foo='bar'
        ))
        yield result.encode()


with given(
        wsgi_application,
        title='Quickstart!',
        url='/books/id: 1',
        as_='visitor') as story:

    then(response.status == '200 OK')
    and_('foo' in response.json)
    and_(response.json['foo'] == 'bar')

    when(
        'Trying invalid book id',
        url_parameters={'id': None}
    )

    then(response.status_code == 404)
    and_(
        re.compile('^content-type: text/plain;.*$', re.I) in response.headers
    )
```

### Dumping a `Story`

```python
story.dumps()
```

Produces:

```yaml
base_call:
  as_: visitor
  description: As a member I have to POST a book to the library.
  form:
    name: BDD Book
  query:
    a: b
  response:
    headers:
    - 'Content-Type: application/json;charset=utf-8'
    json:
      foo: bar
    status: 200 OK
  title: Posting a book
  url: /books/:id
  url_parameters:
    id: '1'
  verb: GET
calls:
- response:
    headers:
    - 'Content-Type: text/plain;charset=utf-8'
    status: 404 Not Found
  title: Trying invalid book id
  url_parameters:
    id: None
```

You may load the story again from this yaml with `Story.loads(yaml)`.

There is two additional methods are available to dump and load to 
and from a file: `story.load(file)` and `story.dump(file)`

#### Auto Dumping

You may pass the `autodump` argument of the `given` function to coonfigure the autodumping:

    :param autodump: A string which indicates the filename to dump the story, or
                     a `callable(story) -> filename` to determine the filename.
                     A file-like object is also accepted.
                     Default is `None`, mean autodumping is disabled by default.
 

### Markdown

You can use `story.document([formatter_factory=MarkdownFormatter])` to generate documentation 
in arbitrary format for example: `Markdown`.

There is also a CLI to do this: 

```bash
bddrest document < story.yml > story.md
```
